# Docker Redis

## Introduction

### What is Redis?

Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as
a database, cache, and message broker. Redis provides data structures such as
strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps,
hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes, and streams. Redis has built-in replication,
Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions, and different levels of on-disk
persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic
partitioning with Redis Cluster. [Learn more here](https://redis.io).

### What is Redis Sentinel?

Redis Sentinel provides high availability for Redis. In practical terms this
means that using Sentinel you can create a Redis deployment that resists without
human intervention certain kinds of failures. Redis Sentinel also provides other
collateral tasks such as monitoring, notifications and acts as a configuration
provider for clients. [Learn more here](https://redis.io/topics/sentinel).
